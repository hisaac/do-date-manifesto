		<h2>What Is a Do Date?</h2>

		<p>
			A <strong>Do Date</strong> is a time to give yourself permission to work on the things you <em>want</em> to work on, not on the things you <em>have</em>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			What you work on is up to you. Draw a picture, edit a blog post, write some code, read a book; whatever you feel is worth doing, do that.
		</p>


		<h2>The Tenets</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The goal of a <strong>Do Date</strong> is simply to <em>do</em> things. Nothing more, nothing less.
			</li>
			<li>
				Anything can be done at a <strong>Do Date</strong>.
			</li>
			<li>
				No one will be held accountable to complete the tasks that they plan to work on, or even work on them at all.
			</li>
			<li>
				We will enjoy each other’s company, but work hard not to disturb others while they are working.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Tips for a Successful Do Date</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Have some easy way of notifying the members of your group that you’d like to plan a <strong>Do Date</strong>. My preferred method is email, but it could be Facebook, Twitter, text messaging; whatever works best for your group.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you’d like, it can be nice to tell the group — or post on a social network — what it is you plan to work on. This could be done at a specific time, or just as people arrive.
			</li>
			<li>
				The location of your <strong>Do Date</strong> is obviously up to you, but you’ll want to choose someplace easily accessible by the rest of your group, and quiet enough to concentrate. Our group usually meets in a coffee shop, but other great places are libraries, parks, or someone’s home. Groups can even meet remotely, either via some sort of video chat, or simply through a social network like Twitter.
